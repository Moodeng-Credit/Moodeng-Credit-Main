-- The "Repay a full-limit loan" milestone uses the limit recorded when the loan was repaid, and nothing else.
--
-- It used to fall back to replaying the borrower's loans from the $15 start whenever a loan had no
-- recorded limit. That awarded the milestone to a borrower who was unverified at repayment (no limit is
-- recorded for them) and to referred borrowers who start at $20. The limit is now recorded atomically
-- with the repayment and older loans were backfilled, so the fallback is gone.
-- Only the full-limit-credit-builder branch changes; everything else is as before.
